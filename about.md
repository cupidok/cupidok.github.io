## Research
I am interested in exploring real-world problems from all walks of statistics and actuarial science, primarily those in which the modeling space can be improved by developing a framework that includes spatial statistics. The primary focus of my research has consisted of applying advanced spatial techniques to improve on the actuarial science domains of longevity risk and property and casualty insurance. I am currently working to develop local statistical models for the identification and exploration of patterns in the spatial distribution of mortality rates.

My <a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/440a5f700b7f28d566ba6222627e6bbe/1/advanced">PhD dissertation</a>, which was completed under the supervision of<a href="https://math.asu.edu/node/2745"> Dr. Petar Jevtic</a>, featured an evaluation of the underlying spatial patterns of mortality in the United States, and proposed a variety of modeling techniques to introduce a spatial perspective to the existing body of traditional actuarial mortality models.

## Teaching
Through many collaborative opportunities in teaching, conferences, workshops and seminars, I have practiced both conducting and explaining my research to audiences with widely varying background knowledge. The reward from independent study and research is always supplemented with the opportunity to communicate my understanding to others.  It is the pleasure I take from connecting with students, as they grow in knowledge through a combination of their hard work and my devoted efforts, that is one of the main things that I love about working in academia. It was precisely this love of teaching that inspired me to get a degree in education. Now in looking back on my educational journey, I realize I was blessed with many gifted teachers and had the privilege to take intellectually rewarding classes. All of that, combined with my now gained experiences teaching in the classroom, have shaped who I have become as a teacher. As an educator, my general teaching interests are firmly rooted in statistics, directed towards students of all academic backgrounds
