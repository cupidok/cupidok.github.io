I am interested in exploring real-world problems from all walks of statistics, primarily those in which the modeling space can be improved by developing a framework that includes spatial statistics. The primary focus of my research has consisted of applying advanced spatial techniques to improve on the actuarial science domains of longevity risk and property and casualty insurance. I am currently working to develop local statistical models for the identification and exploration of patterns in the spatial distribution of mortality rates.

My <a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/440a5f700b7f28d566ba6222627e6bbe/1/advanced">PhD dissertation</a>, which was completed under the supervision of<a href="https://math.asu.edu/node/2745"> Dr. Petar Jevtic</a>, featured an evaluation of the underlying spatial patterns of mortality in the United States, and proposed a variety of modeling techniques to introduce a spatial perspective to the existing body of traditional actuarial mortality models.
